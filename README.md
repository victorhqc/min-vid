Min Vid is a Firefox add-on which lets you minimize a web video and
keep it within the browser window. The video panel stays visible even
when you switch tabs, so you can keep watching while you browse.

The goal is to experiment with what it means to start to give the user
control over the media they are consuming on the web. Users should be
able to consume content in whatever mean they feel comfortable. In the
future we may be exploring these concepts with other forms of media,
such as audio or pdfs.

## Usage

Once the addon is installed you are able to launch Min Vid from the
overlay icon over videos on YouTube and Vimeo.

You can also launch Min Vid by right clicking on a video link and
sending to the player from the context menu.
