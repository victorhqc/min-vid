# Min-Vid
Min-Vid is a Firefox add-on which lets you minimize a web video and keep it within the browser window. The video panel stays visible even when you switch tabs, so you can keep watching while you browse.

## Usage

Install the xpi located at [dist/addon.xpi](dist/addon.xpi) and right
click on a video link (only YouTube currently supported). In the context
menu you will see an option 'Send to mini player'.
